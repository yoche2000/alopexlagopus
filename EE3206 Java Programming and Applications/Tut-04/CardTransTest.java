/*
	A data file with credit transaction records is given to you.
	Assume the card company has launched a reward program.
	The reward program is as follows:
		- Transaction with amount greater than or equal to minExp is a qualified transaction.
		- Total amount of qualified transactions in a month is greater than or equal to monthlyExp.
		- For each qualified transaction, the card will receive a fixed rebate.

	For example, the minExp for qualified transaction is $500, the monthlyExp is $2500,
	and rebate for each qualified transaction is $10.

	A card has 3 qualified transactions, say $1000, $600, $1500 in a given month.
	Total amount of the qualified transactions is $3100.
	This card will earn 3 x $10 = $30 reward for that month.

	You need to implement the method getReward().
	The method returns a list of cards and the total rewards received by each card.
	Only cards with non-zero reward are included in the output list.
