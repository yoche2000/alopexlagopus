Though there is an error while the shells are testing, it appears to be successful while running. I also tried some many cases that can posssibly occure, they seemed to be working well. 

## Final thoughts
I always use python on cryptogaphy and other problems in CTF, so I just use it right away. It turnd out to be quite troublesome and took me quite a while to use a Makefile to generate an executable with python. However, I did learn something so it's alright.
